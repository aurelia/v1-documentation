# Running your app

Navigate to your project directory and start the development server with:

```bash
au run
```

This command builds your application and starts a minimal web server that serves your app. The development server automatically refreshes your browser when source code changes are detected.

If you chose to use ASP.NET Core and Webpack during project setup, start your application using:

```bash
dotnet run
```
