# Testing

Aurelia provides a powerful testing library called `aurelia-testing` that allows you to test custom elements and attributes in isolation easily. This library helps you create a mini Aurelia application for component testing, making it simple to verify component behavior, data binding, and lifecycle methods.

### Installation

```bash
npm install aurelia-testing
```

Please see the other testing sections to learn how to test attributes, components, mocks and Aurelia-specific libraries.
